* elisp wrappers for querying against zotero.sqlite

  in the fashion of https://github.com/whacked/calibre-mode; will probably merge at some point

  goal is to provide convenience functions / keys to query the zotero db + open files, without having to have a running zotero instance

** issues

*** TODO figure out where the profile directory is

*** TODO figure out how to deal with sqlite db lock

     this one requires a running zotero service... also still in flux.
