* elisp wrappers for querying against zotero.sqlite

  goal is to provide convenience functions / keys to query the zotero db + open files, without having to have a running zotero instance

** requirements

   - @smathot's [[https://github.com/smathot/qnotero][Qnotero]]

** description

   driver script is =qnotero_util.py=; it makes these assumptions:
   
*** Qnotero library

    currently =qnotero= is an import in the python utility script;
    it is expected to reside in =/opt/qnotero=

*** Zotero database location
    
    assumed to be within a $HOME/[Mm]ozilla/[Ff]irefox/Profiles/*.default/zotero

** example elisp query

   more functionality to be added later. also, the =devel= branch's elisp is completely separate

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value
     (require 'json)
     (let ((item-list
            (let ((query "NiPype")
                  (json-object-type 'plist))
              (json-read-from-string
               (base64-decode-string
                (first
                 (last
                  (split-string
                   (calibre-chomp
                    (shell-command-to-string
                     (format "python3 qnotero_util.py '%s'" query)))
                   "\n"))))))))
       
       (plist-get
        (elt item-list 0)
        :title))

   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : Nipype: A Flexible, Lightweight and Extensible Neuroimaging Data Processing Framework in Python

** devel branch

   contains an older, separate querying method directly against the sqlite db in the fashion of https://github.com/whacked/calibre-mode;

   *eventually these repos will probably merge*
