* elisp wrappers for querying against zotero.sqlite

  goal is to provide convenience functions / keys to query the zotero db + open files, without having to have a running zotero instance

** current functionality

   *still in progress*

   - =M-x zotero-query= to search against db; launches a hydra menu for further action
   - =zotero:doi:10.9999/example= style or =zotero:Some Title Text= org-mode links (export formatter is not yet implemented)
     - =C-c C-c= in org-mode on a =zotero:= link triggers the query action
   - insert org-pdfview link or other information from result selection
   - =M-x pdf-annot-trigger= on =pdfview= link
     - insert text extraction of annotations in pdf
     - select specific text annotation from =helm= menu + insert
   
** dependencies

   - sql.el (Emacs included, in progmodes)
   - [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]]
   - [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][abo-abo's hydra]]

** Zotero database location
   
   set / override using =zotero-db= var.
   On Windows, it will try to discover from the HOME path (i.e. =C:\Users\youruser\Zotero=)

* development

** Zotero data model
