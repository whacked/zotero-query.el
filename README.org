* elisp wrappers for querying against zotero.sqlite

  in the fashion of https://github.com/whacked/calibre-mode; will probably merge at some point

  goal is to provide convenience functions / keys to query the zotero db + open files, without having to have a running zotero instance

** requirements

   - @smatnot's [[https://github.com/smathot/qnotero][Qnotero]]

** description

   driver script is =qnotero_util.py=; it makes these assumptions:
   
*** Qnotero library

    currently =qnotero= is an import in the python utility script;
    it is expected to reside in =/opt/qnotero=

*** Zotero database location
    
    assumed to be within a $HOME/[Mm]ozilla/[Ff]irefox/Profiles/*.default/zotero
